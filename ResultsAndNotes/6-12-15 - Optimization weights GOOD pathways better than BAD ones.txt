Running FireGirlTrials.MDP_bad_pol

First run, 10 pathways x 10 years
Second,    50 pathways x 50 years
Third,    100 pathways x 100 years
Suppression costs 300/300
Feature AND value normalization (J3.1)

Results:
10x10 and 100x100 both succeeded in weighting the "good" pathways far more heavily than the "bad" ones.
50x50 failed to find improvements. I don't have a clear sense of why.
