Running Monte Carlo rollouts of the policy generated on Friday from the J3.1 100x100 optimization

Result:
The average value of pathways generated by the new policy were slightly better (significantly?) than
the bad pathways in the optimization set.  They were far, far worse than the values of the good pathways...


>>> polFG=FireGirlPolicy.FireGirlPolicy()
>>> polFG.setParams(pol.b)
>>> polFG.getParams()
[-141.57, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0]

>>> mc_pws = trials.MDP_generate_standard_set(policy=polFG, supp_var_cost=300, supp_fixed_cost=300)
A very large fire has occured... Pathway: 13  Year: 2  Burn Time: 10.295
A very large fire has occured... Pathway: 38  Year: 49  Burn Time: 10.287
A very large fire has occured... Pathway: 65  Year: 23  Burn Time: 15.184

:Note: Lots of suppression happened... only a few big fires.
