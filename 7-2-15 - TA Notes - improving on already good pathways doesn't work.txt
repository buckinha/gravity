___I___
Generated 200 pathways under nominal_SA ([1,0,0,...0])

___II___
TA four times starting from nominal_SA
TA four times starting from CT
Rolled out 20 pathways for each of the 8 policies
Results:
	The four using nominal_SA TA policies were negative valued
	The four using CT TA policies were in the 1.4 to 1.5M range (quite good)

___III___
Generating 50 pathways each under the four CT TA Policies
Results:
	Average values from 1.42 to 1.48M (pretty good)

___IV___
Running TA four times starting from the best TA policy
Running TA four times from CT
Rolled out 20 pathways each for the 8 policies
Results:
	All 8 pathway sets are negatively valued

___V___
Combining the rollouts from the 8 policies in II and IV
Running TA four times from CT
Rolling out 20 pathways each
Results:
	They are all negatively valued


Thoughts:
The normalization step involves setting the good/bad divide somewhere. I'm using the mean. But what if all the pathways are bad? What if they're all good?  If we roll out pathways under a good policy, and all end up having pretty good values, then how do we tell the computer
to split up from there. It'll have to negatively value SOMETHING...
